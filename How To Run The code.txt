to add a video you must put it on the data/video folder
then modify the directory in the main code ( CODE_DETECTION_SANS_GARDER_LA_TRACE / CODE_DETECTION_FINALE )
and it's ok, now the output will be in the folder /data/video ) 
the code contains comments.

launch code_detection_finale.py and watch the results ( the output video will be stored
 in the data/video under the name result)
